# Deep Learning Lab Experiments

1) Case study of the following deep learning packages:

    - tensorflow

    - keras

    - theano

    - pytorch

    - lasagne

    - scikitlearn

    - microsoft cntk (cognitive toolkit)

    - MXNet

    Lab conducted on 23/07/2025.

2) design a single unit percepton for classifying linearly separable binary datasets without using any predefined models.

    Expected for lab on 30/07/2025.

3) identify problems with single perceptron and implement classification or, and, xor.

4) build an ann by implementing backpropagation algorithm using various activation functions and compare them.
