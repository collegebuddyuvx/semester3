# Deep Learning Lab Experiments

1) Case study of the following deep learning packages:

    - tensorflow
    - keras
    - theano
    - pytorch
    - lasagne
    - scikitlearn
    - microsoft cntk (cognitive toolkit)
    - MXNet

2) design a single unit percepton for classifying linearly separable binary datasets without using any predefined models.

3) identify problems with single perceptron and implement classification or, and, xor.

4) build an ann by implementing backpropagation algorithm using various activation functions and compare them.
