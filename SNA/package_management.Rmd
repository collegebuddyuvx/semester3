In R, when you load a library, it may mask functions or objects from previously loaded libraries or the base environment if they share the same name. To avoid or handle this, you can use the following strategies:

1. Use Explicit Namespace

Always specify the package name explicitly when calling a function to avoid ambiguity. For example:

```
dplyr::filter(data, condition)
stats::filter(data)
```

This ensures you're using the function from the intended package.

2. Load Libraries in a Specific Order

Load the library with the desired function last. For example:

```
library(dplyr)
library(xgboost)  # If xgboost masks dplyr functions, load it after dplyr.
```

However, this is not foolproof and can still lead to confusion.

3. Detach the Masking Package

If a package is masking functions you need, you can detach it:

```
detach("package:xgboost", unload = TRUE)
```

This removes the package from the search path, resolving conflicts.

4. Avoid Loading the Entire Library

Instead of loading the entire library with `library()`, use `::` to access specific functions without attaching the package:

```
xgboost::xgb.train(params, data)
```

5. Check for Masking Warnings

When loading a library, R often warns about masked functions. Pay attention to these messages to identify potential conflicts.

By following these practices, you can minimize issues caused by masking and ensure your code behaves as expected.
