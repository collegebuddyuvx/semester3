3. ## Growth Models

   Network growth models are mathematical frameworks used to understand how networks evolve over time by adding nodes and edges. Here are some of the most fundamental models:

   ### üìà Basic Network Growth Models

   #### 1. **Uniform Random Attachment**

   - Each new node connects to an existing node chosen uniformly at random.
   - **Mechanism**: New nodes connect randomly to existing nodes.
   - **Outcome**: Degree distribution tends to be exponential.
   - **Limitation**: Doesn‚Äôt capture the heavy-tailed distributions seen in real-world networks like social or citation networks.

   #### 2. **Preferential Attachment (Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert Model)**

   - Nodes are added one at a time and preferentially attach to existing nodes with high degree.
   - **Mechanism**: New nodes are more likely to connect to nodes that already have many connections.
   - **Outcome**: Produces a power-law (heavy-tailed) degree distribution.
   - **Real-world analogy**: ‚ÄúRich-get-richer‚Äù effect‚Äîpopular websites or influencers attract more links or followers.

   #### 3. **Multiplicative Growth Model**

   - Each node‚Äôs degree grows multiplicatively over time. This is more abstract, often used in weighted networks.
   - **Mechanism**: Objects (nodes) grow in size over time, with larger ones growing faster.
   - **Outcome**: Can lead to Pareto distributions, matching the skewness of real networks.
   - **Application**: Used in modeling economic or biological networks.

   #### 4. **Yule‚ÄìSimon Model**

   - A model of preferential attachment with a probability of introducing new nodes vs reinforcing existing ones.
   - **Mechanism**: With some probability, a new node is added; otherwise, an existing node is duplicated or reused.
   - **Outcome**: Generates robust power-law distributions.
   - **Example**: Word frequency in documents‚Äînew words vs. repeated ones.

   #### 5. **Specialization Model**

   - Nodes specialize by duplicating and modifying their connections.
   - **Mechanism**: Selects a subset of nodes and evolves the network by specializing over those vertices.
   - **Outcome**: Can model complex real-world growth patterns.
   - **Use case**: Biological networks or evolving web graphs.

   #### 6. Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi Model (Random Graph)

   - This model adds edges between nodes randomly.

   #### 7. Watts‚ÄìStrogatz Model (Small-World Network)

   - Starts with a regular lattice and rewires edges randomly to introduce shortcuts.

   #### 8. Ring Lattice

   - A regular graph where each node is connected to its ùëò nearest neighbors in a ring topology.

   #### 9. Prices Model

   - A precursor to the Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert model, where nodes attach preferentially based on degree, but with a tunable initial attractiveness.

   #### 10. Local-World Model

   - Nodes attach preferentially within a randomly selected local subset of the network.

   #### 11. Edging in Preferential Attachment

   - A variation where new nodes connect preferentially, and additional edges are added between existing nodes.

   ### üß† Why These Models Matter

   - They help explain phenomena like viral content spread, academic citation patterns, and the emergence of hubs in social networks.
   - They‚Äôre foundational in fields like network science, epidemiology, and data science.
