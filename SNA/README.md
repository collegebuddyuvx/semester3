4. ## Growth Models

   Implementation of various network growth models (Date: 29/08/2025)

   Network growth models are mathematical frameworks used to understand how networks evolve over time by adding nodes and edges. Here are some of the most fundamental models:

   ### üìà Basic Network Growth Models

   #### 1. **Uniform Random Attachment**

   - Each new node connects to an existing node chosen uniformly at random.
   - **Mechanism**: New nodes connect randomly to existing nodes.
   - **Outcome**: Degree distribution tends to be exponential.
   - **Limitation**: Doesn‚Äôt capture the heavy-tailed distributions seen in real-world networks like social or citation networks.

   #### 2. **Preferential Attachment (Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert Model)**

   - Nodes are added one at a time and preferentially attach to existing nodes with high degree.
   - **Mechanism**: New nodes are more likely to connect to nodes that already have many connections.
   - **Outcome**: Produces a power-law (heavy-tailed) degree distribution.
   - **Real-world analogy**: ‚ÄúRich-get-richer‚Äù effect‚Äîpopular websites or influencers attract more links or followers.

   #### 3. **Multiplicative Growth Model**

   - Each node‚Äôs degree grows multiplicatively over time. This is more abstract, often used in weighted networks.
   - **Mechanism**: Objects (nodes) grow in size over time, with larger ones growing faster.
   - **Outcome**: Can lead to Pareto distributions, matching the skewness of real networks.
   - **Application**: Used in modeling economic or biological networks.

   #### 4. **Yule‚ÄìSimon Model**

   - A model of preferential attachment with a probability of introducing new nodes vs reinforcing existing ones.
   - **Mechanism**: With some probability, a new node is added; otherwise, an existing node is duplicated or reused.
   - **Outcome**: Generates robust power-law distributions.
   - **Example**: Word frequency in documents‚Äînew words vs. repeated ones.

   #### 5. **Specialization Model**

   - Nodes specialize by duplicating and modifying their connections.
   - **Mechanism**: Selects a subset of nodes and evolves the network by specializing over those vertices.
   - **Outcome**: Can model complex real-world growth patterns.
   - **Use case**: Biological networks or evolving web graphs.

   #### 6. Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi Model (Random Graph)

   - This model adds edges between nodes randomly.

   #### 7. Watts‚ÄìStrogatz Model (Small-World Network)

   - Starts with a regular lattice and rewires edges randomly to introduce shortcuts.

   #### 8. Ring Lattice

   - A regular graph where each node is connected to its ùëò nearest neighbors in a ring topology.

   #### 9. Prices Model

   - A precursor to the Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert model, where nodes attach preferentially based on degree, but with a tunable initial attractiveness.

   #### 10. Local-World Model

   - Nodes attach preferentially within a randomly selected local subset of the network.

   #### 11. Edging in Preferential Attachment

   - A variation where new nodes connect preferentially, and additional edges are added between existing nodes.

   ### üß† Why These Models Matter

   - They help expla in phenomena like viral content spread, academic citation patterns, and the emergence of hubs in social networks.
   - They‚Äôre foundational in fields like network science, epidemiology, and data science.

   Random walks and their applications.
   Date: 22/09/2025

   Random walks are a fundamental mathematical tool used to extract information from the structure of complex networks, including social networks. They model the stochastic movement of a walker from one node to another, and their behavior can reveal important properties about the network, such as node centrality, community structure, and the flow of information or influence.
   In social network analysis, random walks are particularly valuable for tasks like ranking entities, identifying influential individuals, and detecting communities.

   One of the most well-known applications is Google's PageRank algorithm, which uses a personalized random walk to rank web pages based on their importance within the network.
   This concept extends to social networks for tasks like friend suggestion, where the similarity between users is measured by the likelihood of a random walk connecting them.
   Random walks also underpin various centrality measures, such as betweenness centrality based on the frequency with which a node is traversed by a random walk between other nodes, providing a more nuanced view than traditional shortest-path methods.

   Beyond ranking and centrality, random walks are applied in community detection. By analyzing the probability flow of random walks, researchers can identify densely connected groups or communities within a network, which is crucial for understanding the multipartite organization of social systems.
   They are also used in semi-supervised learning and network embedding, where the walk patterns help represent nodes in a lower-dimensional space while preserving structural relationships.

   Recent research has explored the use of random walks in more complex scenarios, such as analyzing multilayer networks to identify leaders in criminal networks, where classical and quantum random walks are used to define new centrality metrics based on node occupation.
   Furthermore, random walks are integral to recommendation systems, where biased random walks can incorporate social influence and user preferences to improve recommendation accuracy and mitigate cold-start problems.
   Despite their utility, random walks can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as link deletion or addition, which can significantly alter the hitting time (time to reach a target node) and cover time (time to explore the entire network), highlighting the need for robust algorithms.
